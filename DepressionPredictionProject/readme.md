* This dataset is data collected over a period of time for students at Dartmouth College.
* To obtain this dataset, the researchers distributed smart phones to students and conducted an Ecological Instantaneous Assessment (EMA) at the same time as collecting sensor data.
* In this project, students' responses to various Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses are used to predict students' depression.
* More information about the datasets associated with EMA can be found [Student life Dataset](https://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/dataset.html)
